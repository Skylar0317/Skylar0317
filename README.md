## 🔍 About Me

I’m an adventurer at heart—whether it’s diving into new datasets, picking up a new language, or trying something that terrifies me just a little (like skydiving... or debugging a regression model).  

I thrive on challenges and unfamiliarity. I believe growth comes from the unknown—but when things get overwhelming, I take a breath… or a nap 😌

Also, full disclosure: I believe potatoes are the ultimate form of resilience.  
Fried, mashed, roasted, shredded—they’ve never let me down, and they’re the closest thing I have to a life philosophy.  

Academically, I work at the intersection of economics, statistics, and storytelling—exploring how humans and markets respond to change, uncertainty, and technology.

## 🎬 Outside the Dataset

- Astronomy keeps me grounded—nothing humbles and inspires me more than staring at stars that have burned for billions of years. 🛸  
- Certified skill hoarder — one week it’s SQL, the next it’s latte art  
- Loves snorkeling 🐠, wants to try skydiving (nervous but manifesting it!) 🪂  
- I hate rainy days... but weirdly miss them when they’re gone 🌧️  
- Dreaming of a cat-and-dog cohabitation life… though I’m not sure I’m emotionally ready 😅  
- ✈️ Traveling isn’t just a hobby—it's how I learn. I’m into **slow, intentional travel**: getting lost in local bookstores, observing how cities breathe, having unplanned conversations, and learning through the everyday lives of people far from mine.
